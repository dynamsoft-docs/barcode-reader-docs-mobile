## About Dynamsoft Barcode Reader Android Samples

Before you start viewing the samples, the following concepts may help you understand how to get started with Dynamsoft Barcode Reader.

### License

You need a valid license to unlock the full feature of **Dynamsoft Barcode Reader**. Otherwise, the barcode results will be encoded and the coordinates of barcode location results are offset.

- The samples on GitHub are provided with time-limited free trial, which require network connection to work.
- You can request a 30-day trial license via the [Request a Trial License](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?product=dbr&utm_source=docs&package=android){:target="_blank"} link.
- If you download the sample along with the <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/downloads/?utm_source=docs#mobile" target="_blank">Installation Package</a>, it comes with a 30-day trial license by default.

### Scan Mode

Here we define 3 different scan modes:

- **One-off scanning**: Scan barcode(s) from the video streaming and stop scanning after barcode results are output.
- **Continuous scanning**: Scan barcode(s) from the video streaming and output barcode results continuously.
- **Image decoding**: Read barcode(s) from an image, an image in the memory or a bitmap by triggering [image decoding method(s)](../api-reference/primary-decode.html).

For the majority of our samples, one-off scanning and continuous scanning from the video streaming are using **Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer** (DCE) to capture the video streaming. For the features and APIs of DCE please view <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/camera-enhancer/docs/mobile/programming/android/" target="_blank">DCE online documents</a>. You can also use a third party library like CameraX to capture the video streaming.

### Performance

In the samples, we demonstrate the performance settings from 3 different aspects: **Speed**, **Read Rate** and **Accuracy**. The parameter configurations are generally speed-friendly, read-rate-friendly and accuracy-friendly settings but might not be the best settings for your usage scenario. The performance sample can help you get a basic understanding of the Dynamsoft Barcode Reader parameters. Please feel free to <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/contact/" target="_blank">contact us</a> for further support on optimizing the parameters.

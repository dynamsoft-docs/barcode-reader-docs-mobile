# ReadADriversLicense Sample

The PDF417 barcode on an AAMVA compatible driver's license contains a lot of information that is encoded following the DL/ID Card Design Standard. By aggregating the `DynamsoftCodeParser` library, you can extract the drivers' information from the barcode decoding results.

The following sample shows how to use Dynamsoft Android SDKs to read a driver's license and extract its information.

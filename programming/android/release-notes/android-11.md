# Release Notes for Android SDK - 11.x

## 11.2.1000 (10/16/2025)

### ðŸŽ‰Milestone Release

Version 11.2.1000 introduces a series of AI-driven improvements designed to enhance barcode detection accuracy, processing speed, and configuration flexibility.

This release focuses on practical performance gains for production environments across retail, logistics, and manufacturing workflows.

### âœ¨ Key Highlights

#### AI-Powered Barcode Detection and Decoding

- New Localization Models â€“ Introduces [`OneDLocalization`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/localization-modes.html#modelnamearray) and [`DataMatrixQRCodeLocalization`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/localization-modes.html#modelnamearray) neural network models for improved detection of **blurred / low-resolution 1D codes**, or **partially damaged DataMatrix/QR codes**.
- Specialized Decoders â€“ Adds [`EAN13Decoder`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/deblur-modes.html#modelnamearray) and [`Code128Decoder`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/deblur-modes.html#modelnamearray) models optimized for **long-distance** and **motion-blurred** decoding scenarios.
- Redesigned Deblur Model â€“ The [`OneDDeblur`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/deblur-modes.html#modelnamearray) model now provides more effective recovery from **motion and focus blur**.
- Configurable Model Selection â€“ The new `ModelNameArray` parameter supports flexible model loading and fine-grained control for specific barcode types.

#### Precision and Processing Control

- Enhanced Deblur Methods â€“ [`DM_DEEP_ANALYSIS`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/deblur-modes.html#dm_deep_analysis) now includes sub-level control with `OneDGeneral`, `TwoDGeneral`, and `EAN13Enhanced` options.
- Barcode Count Expectation â€“ The new [`ExpectedBarcodesCount`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-format-specification/expected-barcodes-count.html) parameter enables **format-specific quantity control** and **early termination** in fixed-count workflows.
- Improved Region Detection â€“ The new [`RPM_GRAY_CONSISTENCY`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}image-parameter/region-predetection-modes.html#rpm_gray_consistency) mode provides more precise region extraction based on **grayscale uniformity** and **local consistency** for document and label processing.

### Performance Highlights

#### Barcode Workflows

- Up to **26.5%** higher read rates under blur conditions with as much as **44%** faster processing.
- Reliable decoding of DataMatrix and QR codes with missing or damaged finder patterns.
- Extended operational range beyond 75 cm for long-distance barcode scanning.

### Developer Notes

- Backward Compatibility â€“ Fully compatible with existing integrations; no code-level changes required for upgrade.
- Configuration Flexibility â€“ Expanded parameter set allows comprehensive model configuration for scenario-specific tuning.
- Production Stability â€“ All new models validated in enterprise environments.

### New

- Added a new method, [`switchCapturingTemplate`]({{ site.dcvb_android_api }}capture-vision-router/multiple-file-processing.html#switchcapturingtemplate), which allows switching templates dynamically during the image processing workflow.
- Added a new method, [`clearDLModelBuffers`]({{ site.dcvb_android_api }}capture-vision-router/settings.html#cleardlmodelbuffers), to release memory by clearing buffered deep learning models.
- Added a new method, [`setGlobalIntraOpNumThreads`]({{ site.dcvb_android_api }}capture-vision-router/settings.html#setglobalintraopnumthreads), to configure the global number of threads used for model execution.
- Added a new button, `cameraToggleButton`, to the `CameraView`, allowing users to switch between the front and back cameras.
The following APIs are provided for configuring the `cameraToggleButton`:
  - [`setCameraToggleButton`]({{ site.dce_android }}auxiliary-api/dcecameraview.html#setcameratogglebutton)
  - [`setCameraToggleButtonVisible`]({{ site.dce_android }}auxiliary-api/dcecameraview.html#setcameratogglebuttonvisible)
  - [`getCameraToggleButtonVisible`]({{ site.dce_android }}auxiliary-api/dcecameraview.html#getcameratogglebuttonvisible)

## 11.0.5000 (07/29/2025)

### New

- **Supported 16 KB page sizes**.

### Changed

- **License Validation Behavior**: Instead of stopping execution immediately on an invalid license module, the library now continues processing and returns results from modules with valid licenses. An error is still reported to indicate the license issue.

### Fixed

- Fixed various minor bugs and improved overall stability.

## 11.0.3100 (05/30/2025)

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where `CameraEnhancer.open ` might not work when triggered before the finish of the onCreate of the lifecycle.
- Fixed a bug where the click event of the `ArcDrawingItem` might not be triggered when there is a `ScanRegion`.
- Fixed a bug where the `ArcDrawingItem` might be displayed incorrectly when there is a `ScanRegion`.

## 11.0.3000 (05/15/2025)

### [Highlights](https://www.dynamsoft.com/release-highlights/?product=dbr11.0)

- Workflow Improvements
  - Restructured the parameter control hierarchy at all levels for finer scope definition and more granular process management, with the stage level newly added.
  - Enabled custom combinations and sequences of sections, increasing flexibility and operational customization under specific conditions.

- Deep Learning Integration
  - Improved the reading rate of 1D barcode by introducing a new deblurring deep-learning model.

- Algorithm Enhancements
  - Enabled deduplication at the Region of Interest (ROI) level to consolidate results from multiple tasks.
  - Improved the **CODE_128** and **DataMatrix** DeepAnalysis algorithms for better decoding accuracy and performance.
  - Added support for new barcode types: **CODE_32**, **MATRIX_25**, **KIX**, and **TELEPEN**.

- Engineering Optimizations
  - Unified template-loading logic to reduce I/O overhead.
  - Implemented conversion functionality between `CImageData` and image files, including both on-disk and in-memory files.

# Dynamsoft Barcode Reader Android Edition

Dynamsoft Barcode Reader (DBR) SDK Android Edition is a barcode reading tool designed specifically for Android developers.

You can either get a quick start with the [BarcodeScanner APIs](api-reference/barcode-scanner/index.md) or experience a highly customizable development with the [foundational APIs](api-reference/index.md). Furthermore, DBR provides a powerful [parameter]({{ site.dcvb_parameters}}file/index.html?lang=android) system in order to cope with various scenarios.

## Develop with BarcodeScanner APIs

`BarcodeScanner` is a component with the following features:

- Minimal Code: High-level APIs achieve full functionality with one line of code.
- Ready-to-Use UI: Pre-integrated components and UI enable quick setup.
- Common Customization: Configuration objects simplify typical algorithm and UI setups.

`BarcodeScanner` supports 2 different Scanning Modes

- Single Barcode Scanning Mode
  1. Scans any number of barcodes but returns only one result.
  2. Speed prioritized.
  3. Requires user to select one as the result when scanned multiple barcodes.
- Multiple Barcodes Scanning Mode
  1. Scans multiple barcodes and returns all scanned results.
  2. Read-rate prioritized.

> Note: If you are looking for a solution to scan large batches of barcodes, please refer to the [`BatchBarcodeScanner`](https://www.dynamsoft.com/use-cases/batch-barcode-scanning/){:target="_blank"}. The `BatchBarcodeScanner` has much higher ability on scanning large number of barcodes. It also provides you a highly interactable UI for result previewing, editing, saving, reusing and sharing.

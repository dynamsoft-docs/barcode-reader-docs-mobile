# EnumLocalizationMode

Enumeration `EnumLocalizationMode` specifies the strategies used to identify the locations of barcodes within an image.

*Assembly:* Dynamsoft.BarcodeReader.Maui

```csharp
namespace Dynamsoft.BarcodeReader.Maui
{
    public enum EnumLocalizationMode : long
    {
        /** Omits the localization process entirely. */
        LM_SKIP = 0,

        LM_AUTO = 1,
        /** Identifies barcodes by finding connected blocks, offering optimal results, especially recommended for highest priority in most scenarios. */
        LM_CONNECTED_BLOCKS = 2,
        /** Detects barcodes through analysis of patterns of contiguous black and white regions, tailored for QR Codes and DataMatrix codes. */
        LM_STATISTICS = 4,
        /** Locates barcodes by identifying linear patterns, designed primarily for 1D barcodes and PDF417 codes. */
        LM_LINES = 8,
        /** Provides rapid barcode localization, suited for interactive applications where speed is crucial. */
        LM_SCAN_DIRECTLY = 16,
        /** Targets barcode localization through detection of specific mark groups, optimized for Direct Part Marking (DPM) codes. */
        LM_STATISTICS_MARKS = 32,

        LM_STATISTICS_POSTAL_CODE = 64,
        /** Initiates barcode localization from the image center, facilitating faster detection in certain layouts. */
        LM_CENTRE = 128,

# EnumCameraPosition

`EnumCameraPosition` is an enumeration that defines the possible camera positions that are available to a device. The majority of modern mobile devices have a front and a rear camera. The more recent iPhones also come with multiple rear cameras, each being suited to different scenarios.

## Definition

*Assembly:* dynamsoft_capture_vision_flutter

```dart
enum EnumCameraPosition
{
    /** The default, back-facing camera. It is a wide-angle camera for general usage. **/
    back,
    /** The front-facing camera. **/
    front,
    /** The back-facing ultra-wide-angle camera - which should be used for macro-distance scenarios. (iOS ONLY) **/
    backUltraWide,
    /** The back-facing virtual camera that can automatically switch between the default wide-angle and the ultra-wide-angle cameras. Supported devices include: iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max. **/
    backDualWideAuto
}
```

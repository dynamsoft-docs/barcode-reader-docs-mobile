# EnumValidationStatus

`EnumValidationStatus` is an enumeration that represents whether the associated field's value passed the internal validation checks.

> [!NOTE]
> An example of a failed validation check is if the month of a birth date is April 31 for instance. Since that is anb invalid day, the date of birth field will be marked as invalid. The validation check does not compare the info of a parsed field against a database or anything of the kind in order to verify if the information is correct.

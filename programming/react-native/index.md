# Dynamsoft Barcode Reader React Native Edition

Dynamsoft Barcode Reader (DBR) SDK React Native Edition is a barcode reading tool designed specifically for React Native developers.

DBR React Native provides rich API for developers to easily integrate barcode reading functionality into your React Native applications. When you start the development journey with DBR React Native, you can choose the **Ready-To-Use Edition** or the **Foundational Edition** - with each providing its own set of benefits.

- ***Ready-To-Use Edition***: This edition of the library comes with its own, built-in, sophisticated UI for the camera view. This edition also simplifies the Barcode Reader configuration and focuses on the core configurations of the Barcode Reader. Overall, this edition allows the developer to spend less time worrying about the UI and the extra steps needed to configure the Barcode Reader, but takes away some of the more intricate configurations that can be applied to the Barcode Reader.
- ***Foundational Edition***: This edition of the library is built using the foundational Capture Vision API - allowing the user more detailed control over the initialization and configuration of the Barcode Reader. This edition does not come with a built-in UI like the Ready-To-Use Edition, so the UI setup will fall on the developer. However, using the Foundational Edition does open up a larger variety of parameters that can be controlled via the settings (which can still be used in the RTU Edition, but only via a JSON template).

Furthermore, DBR provides a powerful parameter system in order to cope with various scenarios. Read <a href="{{ site.dcvb_parameters }}file/index.html">Parameter Reference</a> for details.

# Does the SDK Support iOS Bitcode Framework?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.html)

Yes, DBR iOS does allow the user to enable bitcode in their project if they would like to. Enabling bitcode can potentially reduce the app's total size.

In order to enable bitcode, access the *Build Settings* of the project via Xcode and find the *Enable Bitcode* option to toggle it on.

## About Dynamsoft Barcode Reader iOS Samples

Before you start viewing the samples, the following concepts may help you understand how to get started with Dynamsoft Barcode Reader.

### License

A network connection is required to verify the trial license in the samples. You can request a 30-day trial license via the [Request a Trial License](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?product=dbr&utm_source=docs&package=android){:target="_blank"} link. If you download the [Installation Package](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/downloads/?utm_source=docs#mobile), it comes with a 30-day trial license by default.

### Performance

In the samples, we demonstrate the the performance settings from 3 different aspects: **Speed**, **Read Rate** and **Accuracy**. The parameter configurations are generally speed-friendly, read-rate-friendly and accuracy-friendly settings but might not be the best settings for your usage scenario. The samples can help you get a basic understanding of the Dynamsoft Barcode Reader parameters. Please feel free to <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/contact/" target="_blank">contact us</a> for further support on optimizing the parameters.

### Video Barcode Decoding

Most of the Dynamsoft Barcode Reader mobile samples are designed for video barcode decoding. Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer (DCE) is used in the video barcode decoding samples to support the acquisition of video input. At the same time, some of the DCE features benefit the barcode decoding, which is illustrated in the samples. For more info on DCE, please visit the <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/camera-enhancer/docs/mobile/programming/ios/" target="_blank">DCE documentation</a>.

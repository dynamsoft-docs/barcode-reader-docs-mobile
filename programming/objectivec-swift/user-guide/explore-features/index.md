# Explore Features

Once you have got an application running with Dynamsoft Barcode Reader iOS edition, you can explore the many features of the SDK to see how to make the best out of the SDK.

> If you are just getting started with Dynamsoft Barcode Reader iOS Edition, we recommend that you read [Getting Started](../index.html) first.

## Basic Features

* [Specify barcode formats and count]({{site.features}}barcode-formats-and-count.html?lang=objc,swift)
* [Read barcode from image]({{site.features}}read-different-source.html?lang=objc,swift)
* [Read barcode from video streaming]({{site.features}}read-video-streaming-mobile.html?lang=objc,swift)
* [Read a specific area/region]({{site.features}}barcode-scan-region-mobile.html?lang=objc,swift)
* [Customize the UI]({{site.oc}}ui-configurations.html)

## Handle Difficult Scenarios

While the SDK has been carefully tuned to provide the best possible performance in most use cases, it can be further tweaked to provide an even better performance for barcodes/images of similar characteristics. Read the following topics and see if any of them might be helpful in your case.

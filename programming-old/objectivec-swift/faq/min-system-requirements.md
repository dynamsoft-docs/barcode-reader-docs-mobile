# What are the Minimum System Requirements of Dynamsoft Barcode Reader iOS?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

For iOS, DBR supports the following:

* Supported OS: iOS 9.0 or higher (iOS 11 and higher recommended)

* Supported ABI: arm64 and x86_64

Please note that the **armv7** architecture is not supported. If you are doing a general build for all iOS devices, make sure to exclude it in the build settings.

The x86_64 architecture usually coresponds to the simulator. Please note that in order to use the simulator, you must use the **xcframework** instead of the **framework**.
